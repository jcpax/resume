        <h2>Stamped Tribe</h2>
        <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
        <p>Lead graphic designer for Stamped Tribe. Worked with this diverse international team of travelers in full scale design (logo, website, social media and a variety of promotional materials) to achieve a concise design from a variety of voices. Effectively communicated both verbal and written in order to develop content and strategy for their vision.</p>

            <h3>Stamped Tribe Website</h3>
            <p>I worked closely with the Stamped Tribe team to create their website to fit their growing brand. With my expertise in design and development, I was able to listen to their needs for the site and help create the vision to achieve those goals. A heavy emphasis came on images because of the nature of a travel site; therefore, I utilized carousels and image galleries to highlight locations where members had traveled to.</p>

            <h3>Stamped Tribe Logo</h3>
            <p>Stamped Tribe is a professional open source community that connects travelers with itineraries and travel ideas. Their logo needed to stand out and bring a contemporary look to travel planning. I created the logo by combining the look of a passport stamp and interjected a modern minimalist icon design. The departing jet gives the logo movement, as well as, breaks the mold of traditional travel staples. The colors were picked to create a natural and earthy feel creating elegance and simplicity the clientâ€™s desired throughout the brand.</p>
