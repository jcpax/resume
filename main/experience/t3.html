        <h2>T3</h2>
        <h3>Developer & Designer</h3>
        <p>Collaborated with the T3 marketing department to communicate print and web vision for the company moving into 2019.

            <h3>Bakers ADDY Awards Page</h3>
            <p>An example of one of the several ADDY award pages I made for the T3 client teams for the annual Austin ADDY Awards. A project that really pushed me to understand project planning, communication, and taking charge of my voice in regards to knowing what would be best for each teams' timeline and goals. In the end I delivered over 20 awards pages in a variety of categories with each teams’ appreciation with such elation at seeing their hard work put in the spotlight. </p>

            <h3>Wishes Delivered Sundance Banner</h3>
            <p>Wishes Delivered is an important project to us as well as the clients we worked with to create it. A charity campaign that helps UPS deliver wishes to deserving candidates. I was brought in several times as a rotating member on this team to fill in when deadlines were tough and projects needed an expertise in development or design. Creating the Sundance Film Festival campaign banner to honor this project is one of many ways I contributed to our clients’ success.</p>

            <h3>Gay Gaddis Texas Book Festival</h3>
            <p>While working at T3, one of my responsibilities was working on the personal brand and site of the founder and CEO Gay Gaddis. In working with her brand, I created promotional materials for her debut book <i>Cowgirl Power</i>. I worked closely with Gay and the T3 marketing team to create consistent designs to her book and brand.</p>
